        The bootcamp was based on javascript and react.js and this were held by
        the community SHAPE AI.This was a wonderful and amazing bootcamp.In a
        short interval of time this camp was enough to understand what is
        react.js ad javascript.So the community named SHAPE AI is the best one I
        hered for the stuedents who wants the technical asspects of this cyber
        generation era.So simply go for it.
